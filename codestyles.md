# Java Spring Boot Backend Development Coding Standards

## 1. General Principles

### 1.1. Code Readability

- **Use meaningful variable, method, and class names**: Names should be descriptive and follow camelCase notation (e.g., `userService`, `calculateTotalAmount`).
- **Keep methods short and focused**: Each method should perform a single, well-defined task.
- **Avoid magic numbers and strings**: Use constants instead of hardcoding values directly in the code.

### 1.2. Consistency

- **Follow a consistent coding style**: Whether it's indentation, brace placement, or naming conventions, consistency enhances code readability.
- **Adhere to the project's coding guidelines**: If a set of coding standards is already established, make sure to follow them.

### 1.3. Error Handling

- **Use custom exceptions**: Define custom exceptions to handle specific error scenarios.
- **Provide meaningful error messages**: Error messages should be clear and provide enough information for debugging.

## 2. Project Structure

### 2.1. Package Naming

- **Follow a domain-driven design**: Packages should be named according to the domain they represent (e.g., `com.company.project.user`, `com.company.project.payment`).
- **Keep the main class at the root level**: The main application class should be placed at the top-level package (e.g., `com.company.project.Application`).

### 2.2. Layering

- **Controller Layer**: Responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. Should be placed in the `controller` package.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic. Should be placed in the `service` package.
- **Repository Layer**: Interacts with the database. Should be placed in the `repository` package.
- **Model/Entity Layer**: Defines the data structure. Should be placed in the `model` or `entity` package.

## 3. Coding Practices

### 3.1. Controller Layer

- **Use `@RestController` for RESTful controllers**: This annotation combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`.
- **Map HTTP verbs to methods**: Use `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, and `@DeleteMapping` for respective HTTP operations.
- **Return appropriate HTTP status codes**: Use `ResponseEntity` to customize responses.

### 3.2. Service Layer

- **Keep business logic in services**: Controllers should be thin and delegate work to services.
- **Use `@Service` annotation**: This indicates that the class is a Spring service.
- **Transaction management**: Use `@Transactional` for methods that require transaction management.

### 3.3. Repository Layer

- **Use Spring Data JPA**: It simplifies database interactions.
- **Interface naming**: Repository interfaces should follow the naming convention `EntityNameRepository` (e.g., `UserRepository`).
- **Custom query methods**: Use method names to define queries (e.g., `findByUsername`).

### 3.4. Model/Entity Layer

- **Use JPA annotations**: Annotate entities with `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, etc.
- **Define relationships**: Use `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToOne`, and `@ManyToMany` to define relationships between entities.
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Use DTOs to transfer data between layers, especially when exposing data via APIs.

## 4. Testing

### 4.1. Unit Tests

- **Write tests for each service method**: Use JUnit and Mockito for mocking dependencies.
- **Keep tests simple and focused**: Each test should test a single behavior.

### 4.2. Integration Tests

- **Test the interaction between components**: Ensure that services, repositories, and controllers work together as expected.
- **Use Spring Boot Test**: It provides annotations like `@SpringBootTest` for integration testing.

## 5. Security

### 5.1. Input Validation

- **Validate user inputs**: Use JSR 303/JSR 380 annotations (e.g., `@NotNull`, `@Size`) to validate inputs.
- **Sanitize inputs**: Prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other vulnerabilities by sanitizing inputs.

### 5.2. Authentication and Authorization

- **Use Spring Security**: It provides a comprehensive security framework.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Use JWT for stateless authentication.
- **Role-based access control**: Define roles and permissions to restrict access to certain endpoints.

## 6. Documentation

### 6.1. API Documentation

- **Use Swagger/OpenAPI**: Generate and maintain API documentation automatically.
- **Provide examples**: Include example requests and responses in the documentation.

### 6.2. Code Comments

- **Write self-documenting code**: Code should be clear enough to understand without comments.
- **Use comments to explain complexity**: When necessary, use comments to explain complex logic or algorithms.
